### I'm a driven software developer with a passion for code, design, and problem-solving.

Coding for me is like painting for an artist or composing music for a musician - it's my way of creating, expressing, and most importantly, impacting.

ðŸŽ“ I've honed my skills through a variety of projects - everything from card games to hospital management systems.  
ðŸŽ¨ When I'm not deep in code, you can find me creating beautiful art pieces. You can check out my work [here](https://www.instagram.com/artbyyustina/)! I also foster positive educational environments as an art teacher.

Check out my repositories to see what I've been up to! ðŸ’»
